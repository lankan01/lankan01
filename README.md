## About Me
I'm originally trained as a doctor in London, but I've found my passion in the startup ecosystem in Southeast Asia. I'm excited about technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Bridgeit** - a platform to help companies find developer and data science talent more easily.

## What I'm Learning
I'm always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Currently, I'm focusing on:

- ğŸŒ± Learning **React on Next.js** for building dynamic and performant web applications.
- ğŸŒ± Exploring **Firebase** to handle backend services and database management.
- ğŸŒ± Diving into **Node.js** to build scalable server-side applications.
- ğŸŒ± Improving my design skills with **Figma** to create user-friendly interfaces.
